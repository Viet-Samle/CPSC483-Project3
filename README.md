# CPSC483-Project3
Project 3 for CPSC 483 - Introduction to Machine Learning
Purpose: Given a training set, split the data and find out which model is best for predicting using the ROC curve and AUC values.
Note: Predictions are made using a Gaussian model

Libraries Used: 
* Matploblib - Generate Plots 
* NumPy - Implement operations to manipulate data
* Pandas - Read the dataset and manipulate data
* Scikit-Learn - Implement regression and cross-validation
  * Using different kinds of support vector classifiers
